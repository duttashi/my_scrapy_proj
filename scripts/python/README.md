#### Script Naming Convention

Every script will begin with a prefix of `scrp_`. Followed by a distinct meaningful name, that describe the task the script is meant to perform.

**Note:** The prefix name must not exceed more than 4 characters excluding the hyphen sign.

The scraper's are classified into 3 categories on the basis of their complexity. These are defined as follows;

- **beginner level scraper**: script name begins with, `scrp_init_`. A beginner level scraper is a simple scraper with little to no object-oriented functionality. 
- **intermediate level scraper**: script name begins with, `scrp_midl_`. An intermediate level scraper contains atomic methods.  
- **advanced level scraper**: script name begins with, `scrp_advc_`. An advanced level scraper fully complies with the OOP principles. It has classes, inheritance and methods.
